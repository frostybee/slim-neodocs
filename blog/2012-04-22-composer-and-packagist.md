Iâ€™m happy to announce that the Slim Framework now works with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and is available on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/slim/slim). Andrew Smith at Silent Works has written a tutorial that demonstrates how to use Composer and Packagist to manage dependencies in your Slim application.
