We are pleased to have released Slim 4.14.0. As a mature release, there aren't many changes and all are minor and
can be seen [here](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/releases/tag/4.14.0).

## Type hinting with template generics

This release introduces of [template generic docblocks](https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-in-php-using-phpdocs) into Slim. 

As `Slim\App` has a `getContainer(): ?ContainerInterface` method, the generics docblock enables you to specify what type is actually returned when this method is called. 
i.e. consider that you are using [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org) and have this code:

```
$container = $this->app->getContainer();
$entries = $container->getKnownEntryNames();
```

[Psalm](https://psalm.dev) or [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) have no way of knowing that `$container` is an instance of `DI\Container` which has a `getKnownEntryNames()` method and so will complain.

To inform the static analyzer that we created `Slim\App` with PHP-DI, we change: `/** @var \Slim\App $app */` to `/** @var \Slim\App<DI\Container> $app */` and now PHPStan knows that `getKnownEntryNames()` is a valid method call on `$container`.


### Update your type hints

For your codebase, if you type hint `Slim\App` instance variables using `/** @var \Slim\App $app */`, then you will need to change it to either:

* `/** @var \Slim\App<null> $app */` if you are not using a DI container, or
* `/** @var \Slim\App<\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface> $app */` if you are.

As noted above, you can also type hint to the concrete instance of the container you are using too.
